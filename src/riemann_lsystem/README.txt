LPY
===
FIXME: LPY- Light in scenes for Nurbspatchs (normals seem not well handelled).
    see file 0-different-surfaces.lpy (using SetSpace(Patch(patch1))
FIXME: LPY- the use of a %pastefile primitive messes all line numbers of the lpy file

TODO: LPY- add adequate primitives to PlantGL to handle extrusions in surfaces.py
TODO: Could be nice to make a LPY display as the turtle is interpreting a string  (after each symbol that the turtle reads). This would be a bit similar to the use of contextual <<
This would avoid that the L-string is read in N**2

RIEMANNIAN SIMULATIONS
======================
FIXME: SIMULATIONS- Accelerate geodesic simulations (became slow after length of geodesic step was made variable) ?

TODO: SIMULATIONS- Growth of a surface embedding a tree whose growth is triggered by the growth of the surface
TODO: SIMULATIONS- Growth that is affected by space curvature (in addition of being a geodesic)

TODO: ALGORITHM- Computing the distance between two points on the surface (will make it possible to evaluate the diffusion radius for a random walk)
